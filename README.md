# weather-dashboard

## Description
- The goal of this project was to create a web page that provides a weather dashboard of whatever city you search, and provides a 5-day forecast of the upcoming temperature readings

- I built this project in order to better understand how to implement server API's in which data can be pulled and used to populate web pages dynamically based upon the API outputs

- What I learned on this project is server API integration has a very precise structure in which it can reference external variables, and ultimately that said variables and API pulls need to be within a shared function in order to work properly

## Installation
To install this project, you need to:
-Download the code from the projects GitHub: https://github.com/flammtaro/weather-dashboard

## Usage
This code contains the HTML and CSS of the current version of my portfolio website. An image of the current version of the website can be seen here: !![weather dashboard image](https://i.imgur.com/bu1WKjK.png). The program itself can be used to come up with different password variations for use in any account creation program.
